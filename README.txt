The wrappermaker folder is already updated to use the latest (as of 18/01/2023) ops.pbtxt file and generate the interface for TF 2.11.
Also the tf_wrapper.pas (in units) is the latest generated.

All other units in the units folder is up-to-date.

In the exampes folder the source files (tf_utils.pas and examples.pas) are updated and two files to test are also added.

The former mnist.pas is still worked at, so it might take some time to be back (in the meantime check the old-1.15 branch).

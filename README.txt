The wrappermaker folder is already updated to use the latest (as of 18/01/2023) ops.pbtxt file and generate the interface for TF 2.11.
Also the tf_wrapper.pas (in units) is the latest generated.

All other units in the units folder is up-to-date.

In the exampes folder the source files (tf_utils.pas, examples.pas and mnist.pas) are updated and two files to test are also added. The input files for mnist has to be downloaded separately (because of their size I do not want to add them here unnecessarily).

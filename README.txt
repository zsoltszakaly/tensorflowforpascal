The wrappermaker folder is already updated to use the latest (as of 18/01/2023) ops.pbtxt file and generate the interface for TF 2.11.
Also the tf_wrapper.pas (in units) is the latest generated.

All other units in the units folder is up-to-date.

In the exampes the tf_utils.pas is also up-to-date.

The former examples.pas is being reworked.

The former mnist.pas is not yet looked at, will be done a bit later.
